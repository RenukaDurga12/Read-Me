    <p>
      Welcome to my corner of the VLSI world! I'm Renuka, a passionate
      second-year graduate student at GITAM University in Bangalore. I am
      dedicated to honing my skills and knowledge focusing on VLSI.
    </p></div>
    <div class="about">
    <h3>Education and Background:</h3>
    <p>
      I embarked on my academic journey at GITAM University, where I am pursuing
      a degree that aligns perfectly with my love for technology. As a dedicated
      student, I consistently strive for excellence and eagerly engage in
      opportunities to expand my horizons.
    </p>
    <h3>Technical Proficiencies:</h3>
    <p>
      My toolbox consists of C Programming language and verilog for now,
      primarily used in digital circuit design and verification.Verilog provides
      a concise and expressive syntax for describing digital circuits and
      systems. It allows designers to represent complex digital designs using a
      high-level abstraction, making it easier to understand and manipulate.<br />
      Verilog promotes design productivity by allowing designers to describe
      complex digital systems at a higher level of abstraction. This can lead to
      faster development cycles and reduced time-to-market for VLSI products.
    </p>
    <h3>Passion and Ambition:</h3>
    <p>
      My passion for Verilog stems from its transformative power—the ability to
      breathe life into abstract concepts and mold them into tangible reality.
      In the world of VLSI, Verilog isn't just a language; it's the conduit
      through which I channel my creativity, my ingenuity, and my unwavering
      ambition.<br />
      With every project, I strive to push the boundaries of what's possible, to
      transcend the limitations of conventional thinking, and to unleash the
      full potential of digital design. Verilog empowers me to dream big, to
      envision architectures that redefine paradigms, and to architect solutions
      that shape the course of technology.<br />
      But beyond the syntax and semantics lies a deeper calling—an ambition to
      leave a lasting impact on the world through my work in VLSI design. With
      Verilog as my tool and my ally, I aspire to pioneer innovations that
      revolutionize industries, empower communities, and enrich lives.
